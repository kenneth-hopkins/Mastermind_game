My implementation of Mastermind has 4 main classes. The Game class, Board class
Button class and Marble class. The game class Manages the game of Mastermind.
it initializes the variables, handles clicks and  user interactions,
and stores all the game data as the round progresses. The game class
keeps track of the round, user guess, secret code, buttons, pegs and marbles.

The board class is used for the scoreboard, game board and leaderboard.
The board class divides each board into a grid based on the number of
rows and columns. The x,y coordinate of each cell in this invisible grid
is stored in the class and used for coordinates to draw the board,
place marbles, pegs, buttons etc.

The button class stores the dimensions of the buttons and can tell when it's been clicked.
if the button is clicked it calls a particular method in the game class. For example
if the check button is clicked it calls game.update_peg_colors() and game.check_win_condition().
The majority of the mastermind game is run through these classes.

For testing I tested all of the drawing functions and pressed all of the
clickable buttons to make sure they were behaving as expected. I tested the user's guess
and made sure the game recognized the number of correct colors in correct position,
correct colors in wrong position etc. and that the peg colors were reflective of that.
I tested the function that writes to the leaderboard file by creating a leaderboard file with
more than 10 high scores and making sure only the top 10 scores were kept every time the game was run.
